# 10-Team-Profile-Generator
Organize your team's information in an easy-to-use webpage. Save it as a bookmark to have easy access to your team's contact information.

## Description
This app uses node.js and the "inquirer" package to create a series of questions for the user.
The user inputs a Manager, Engineer, or Intern's information and the app automatically renders an HTML page displaying the information. 

## Accessing the application
Install node.js and run index.js. Select from the menu options:

- Add Manager
- Add Engineer
- Add Intern
- View Database
- Clear Database
- Finish (this creates the HTML file)

To view the HTML file, open /dist/main/index.html on a web browser.
